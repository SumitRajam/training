### Creadentials to Login: username: "hopkins" , password: "William56$hj"
For convinience in testing, I have kept the credentials as default value in input feilds, so just click on log in and it will send POST request to auth endpoint to get token. I am saving the token in local storage. next time when user tries to login, he will be directly redirected to home page if token exists in localstorage.

### All the webpages are fully responsive
The sidebar goes down and looks like the mobile apps navigation bar. This is achieved by adding and removing proper className which have CSS applied to it.
