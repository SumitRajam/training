⿡ Create Context and Reducer for Task Management
Use useContext to create a TaskContext for global state management.
Use useReducer to handle actions like adding, deleting, and toggling tasks.
Task Actions:
ADD_TASK → Adds a new task
REMOVE_TASK → Removes a task
TOGGLE_TASK → Marks a task as completed/incomplete
⿢ Use useMemo to Optimize Task Filtering
Display total completed tasks using useMemo.
Memoize calculations so they don’t re-run unnecessarily.
⿣ Use useCallback to Optimize Event Handlers
Optimize addTask and toggleTask functions using useCallback.
Ensure that these functions don’t unnecessarily re-render child components.
